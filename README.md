__Problem Statement – Set 8 __

A financial organization needs to design a secured authentication system. 
•	The system should accept the user’s credentials and check if the user is legitimate. 
•	In case the user is legitimate it should ask the user whether he wants to know the account balance, make fund transfer and update balance. 
•	In case user is not legitimate inform the admin about unauthorized access
•	If more than 3 wrong login attempts are made for the user then lock the account and do not allow access for that account
•	Secured password based account unlock by legitimate user
•	Get monthly reports of unauthorized access
Design an algorithm to accomplish this and implement the same using C.
